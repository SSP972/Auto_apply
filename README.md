Install Playwright using pip, which is the package installer for Python. Run the following command:

    pip install playwright
Once Playwright is installed, you need to install a browser engine. Playwright supports Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. You can choose one or more browser engines to work with. Run the following command to install Chromium:


    playwright install chromium
If you want to install Firefox, use the command:


    playwright install firefox
And if you want to install WebKit, use the command:


    playwright install webkit
You can install multiple browser engines if needed.

After the browser engine(s) is installed, you are ready to start using Playwright in your Python code.

That's it! Playwright should now be successfully installed on your system. You can import the sync_playwright module in your Python scripts and start using Playwright's API to automate browser interactions.

Remember to import Playwright in your code using:


    from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
You can refer to the official Playwright documentation for more information and examples:
